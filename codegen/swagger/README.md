This autogenerated project defines an API crate `bollard-stubs` which contains:
* Data types representing the underlying data model.

The data types are generated specifically for the [Bollard API client](https://github.com/fussybeaver/bollard), and are not intended for direct library consumption. These data stubs might change as needed by the parent project.

## Package versioning

The upstream Docker API version references the major and minor version of this package. An additional suffix constitutes revisions around the code generator.

## Generating code.

Use the java package manager maven to generate the stubs. Java JDK 8 is required to run these:

```bash
mvn -D org.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=debug clean compiler:compile generate-resources
```
